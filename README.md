Surrender, Sir! - An Arma 3 Script
=====================

## Introduction
Surrender, Sir! is a very simple script for Arma 3 that will allow players to ask A.I. units to surrender or, in the case of civilians, get down on the floor. 

## Concepts
The script is still in the initial stages of development. The following are a concepts outlining how the script could work.
* Initially, the main task would be to get the script to simply have an enemy put his hands above his head or a civilian to go prone and not move when the player asks them to. This is very simple and would be quickly expanded with some more interesting features. Giving enemies a chance percentage to surrender or continue engaging the player would be one of the first things to add as it would randomize the gameplay experience and allow for mission replayability. Eventually, adding a variety of random possible behaviors for the unit to follow - such as surrendering immediately, running away, pretending to put weapon away and then taking it out again, etc. - would be a very good feature.
* Ideally, the script would be dynamic in that it would be able to recognize any and all units a player encounters, identify them as an enemy or civilian by itself, and then add the action to ask those units to surrender if the player is within a certain distance from those units. Functionally, this would require minimal work on the mission designer's part - they would only need to call the script in their init.sqf file or in a player unit's initialization field. The rest of the work would be done already.
* Likely the simplest and quickest way to create the script would be to have it so that a call to the script would be placed in the initialization field of units that can be asked to surrender. A benefit of this method would be that the mission designer can decide which units, specifically, will or will not surrender. It would also only require very simple code to get working. Given that each unit would call the script individually, the parameters of each unit's behavior could be changed should such funtionality be added. The problem with this method of implementation is that adding the surrender action to a large number of units could become tedious. Arguably, though, you could simply group units together and have it so that calling the script in the group leader's initialization field will be enough to add the surrender action to everyone in the group. 
* Something that might be out of the scope of the project (at least intially) but that is related is to have the script be able to recognize when a unit has surrendered and return that value in some form. This would allow for all sorts of things such as being able to give a ruleset to players where they cannot use excessive force e.g. shooting surrendered units would be penalized. This would also allow for something like a task that requires you to make a certain unit surrender.
